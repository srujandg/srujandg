# Code Practice (Java)

This repository contains my daily Java practice programs.  
I am learning Java step by step and committing my progress daily.

## Programs

- HelloWorld.java – First Java program (printing output)  
- Variables.java – Program to understand variables and addition  
- Calculator.java – Simple calculator using if-else conditions  
- CalculatorLoop.java – Menu-driven calculator using while loop with input validation  

## Learning Goals

- Build strong Java basics  
- Practice GitHub daily  
- Prepare for projects and interviews  

## Hi, I'm Srujan 👋

## Daily Learning Log

- **Day 01:** Started my daily GitHub contribution journey. Edited my GitHub profile README and practiced formatting in README.  
- **Day 02:** Practiced GitHub commits and profile updates.  
- **Day 03:** Learned basic Java program structure and operators using "int" datatype.  
- **Day 04:** Learned user input using "Scanner" and basic arithmetic operations in Java.  
- **Day 05:** Built a menu-driven calculator using "While" loop with input validation and exit option.
- **Day 06:** Solved first Codeforces problem (4A – Watermelon) using Java and learned submission process.
- **Day 07:** Solved Codeforces problem (160A – Twins). Understood greedy logic by sorting values and selecting the minimum number of elements such that their sum becomes greater than the remaining sum. Practiced problem-solving using Java and improved confidence with conditional logic and arrays.
- **Day 08:** Practiced Java conditional statements (largest number, leap year) and pushed solutions from GeeksforGeeks.
